.min: Support .idea.free.unalloc and .idea.leak.

.desired: Support .min and .idea.free.free.

.max: Support .idea.*.

.platform: Whilst cross-platform debugging (.idea.xplatform)
 may appear attractive, it isn't clear how useful it is.  Until such
 time as this need is clarified, it is sufficient for the program to
 only be able to debug native applications.
