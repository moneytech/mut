.min: .goal.min

.min.free.unalloc: .idea.free.

.min.leak: .idea.leak.

.desired.free: .idea.free.free.

.inter: The program should not be ethnocentric.  The amount of
 work to produce a version that supports languages other than English
 should consist of little more than translating any messages output by
 the program into the target language.

.platform: The program should work for Linux/ELF/x86/gcc, 
 Linux/a.out/x86/gcc, Linux/a.out/x86/lcc, SunOS/a.out/SPARC/gcc, 
 Solaris/ELF/SPARC/gcc, Irix/ELF/MIPS/gcc.

.lib: The program should also be useable as a library which can be
 linked with other code, for example a different user interface.

.thread: The program should be useable in a threaded environment
 without any chanages.

.leak: The program should not leak memory, except deliberately if
 necessary.

.intertwined-alloc: The program should work correctly with malloc
 libraries where one or more of the routines is written in terms of
 another one.  For example, where realloc is written in terms of free
 and malloc.

.signals: The program should abort gracefully and free up any
 claimed resources on receipt of a terminating signal.
