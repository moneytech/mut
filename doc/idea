.acid: Implement an equivalent of the malloc debugging library
 provided by the ACID debugger as described in <URI:mut/bib/winterbottom>.

.free.unalloc: Report any use of free on a pointer that is not
 allocated by malloc, calloc or realloc.

.free.free: Report any use of free on a pointer that has already
 been passed to free (and has not since been reallocated).

.leak: Report any memory allocated by malloc, calloc and realloc
 that has not been deallocated by free or cfree when the program
 terminates.

.leak.deliberate: Attempt not to report, or report separately,
 memory that is deliberately not deallocated on program exit.

.backtrace: When an error due to .free.unalloc,
 .free.free or .leak is reported, include a backtrace so that
 the user can better identify the source of the problem.

.general: Generalise .idea to cover arbitrary resources.

.general.files: For FILE *, fopen is an allocation, fclose is a
 deallocation, for int, open is an allocation, close is a deallocation.

.general.user: Allow user to define pairs (triples) of
 allocation, (transformation) and deallocation routines including which
 argument/result defines the resource.

.xplatform: ACID allows cross-platform debugging by allowing the
 /proc filesystem on one architecture to be mounted on a machine of
 another architecture (e.g. debugging x86 on a MIPS).

.plot: Produce enough tracing information to be able to plot 
 allocation graphs such as time vs. space, time vs. allocation calls,
 function(s) vs. space.
