.realloc: The alloc.max.space and alloc.max.count values are
 different for realloc tests.  See
 <URI:mut/tests/gen/results.x86/correct/realloc_exe_bfst>.

.tty: Update the interface so that it is correct wrt the sole
 implementation.

.backtrace: Update the interface so that it is correct wrt the
 sole implementation.

.free: Should include a backtrace in a free trace.

.realloc(x,0): XXX.

.simplify.aout: OpenBSD was the last a.out holdout of any system that
 I'm interested in running and changed years ago.  So, unless the goal
 is to run on old systems the a.out code could be removed.

.simplify.build: At the time the project was started it was mainly
 developed on a 486 DX2-66 with 8MB of RAM.  This was adequate but no
 speed daemon.  Having to do a make clean to seitch from one
 configuration to anothe was painful.  So, options are tracked at a
 fine grain level and multiple builds can co-exist.  As I write this
 in 2013 it only takes a few seconds to re-build from scratch.  So,
 again, it would be simpler to remove that support and just have the
 .o files put in the same directory as the .c files, since, like it or
 not, that's what Make really wants unless you fight it using VPATH.

.linux.libc.leaks: see mut/log/20131124 showing that Linux static
 executables leak seeminly by design and for a suggestion on how to
 filter these leaks.
