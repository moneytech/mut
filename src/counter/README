.intro: counter for counting producer/consumer hits.

On a 32-bit machine an unsigned long is usually only 32-bits which is
not necessarily large enough to count the number of hits in a long
running program.  Therefore, the mut_counter type is defined which
hides the actual implementation.

The requried interface is defined in mut_counter.h.  Each
implementation should also provide a mut_counter.c (even if this is
empty -- see ulong version).
