.intro: process tracing via the SysV R4 /proc file system interface.

.status: Partially written.  Abandoned when I found that my Linux
1.3.25 kernel doesn't support the various PIOCxxx codes that are
listed in <URI:mut/bib/nohr>.  After upgrading to 2.0.24 plus up to
date libc ... etc., this doesn't have the PIOCxxx codes either.
