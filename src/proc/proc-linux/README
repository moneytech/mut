.intro: process tracing via the Linux /proc file system interface.

.plan9: The /proc interface under Linux 2 is not like that of SysVr4,
 instead it looks more like a Plan 9 /proc file system.

.mem: It has a /proc/<pid>/mem which allows the memory of a process to
 be read and written (though it isn't clear if write works).

.exe: It has a /proc/<pid>/exe which appears to be equivalent
 to a /proc/<pid>/text in Plan 9.

.reg: In Plan 9 the registers are read and written via
 /proc/<pid>/mem, it is not clear from the kernel code if this is
 supported in the Linux interface -- there is no obvious code to do
 this in the mem interface and I could not see any other interface
 which implements this feature.

.ctl: There does not seem to be an equivalent of /proc/<pid>/ctl to
 control the status of a process.  There are the various
 /proc/<pid>/stat{,m,us} files, but all of them are read only in
 version 2.0.20 (there is no code in the kernel to deal with writes).
