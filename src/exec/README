.intro: executable file reader

.interface: The interface that each reader must support is in
 mut_exec.txt, mut_exec_addr.txt and mut_log_exec_addr.h.

.new: To support a new executable format, just create a new directory
 with the necessary file in it.  For example, to support COFF, create a
 directory called `coff'.
