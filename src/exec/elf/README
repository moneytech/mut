.intro: An executable reader for ELF executables.

Perhaps the easiest way to obtain the required information is to use
the ELF library functions as described in chapter 4 of Nohr
<URI:mut/bib/nohr>.  However, these are not used here.  This is
primarily because the machine that mut was initially developed on
was running a Linux 1.3.34 which didn't include a libelf.

The logical option would be to implement the parts of the library that
would be useful for mut so that when the library was available,
nothing would need to be changed.  However, this was not done.
Instead the required parts of the executable are extracted manually.

The simplest way of extracting the required information from the
executable is to read it (or rather mmap it) all into memory and then 
just overlay the various structs as required.

However, since only the symbol table and string table are needed this
potentially wastes a lot of space (even VM costs!), especially for
large programs (e.g. Motif executables).  Therefore, this version only
reads in the relevant parts.  This is arguably a premature
optimization!
