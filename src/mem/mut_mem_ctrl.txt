.intro: mut_mem_ctrl.h template.

Each mut_mem_ctrl.h file should contain at least the following :-

extern void mut_mem_init(void);

 `mut_mem_init' initialises the memory manager.
 `mut_mem_init' must be called before any other mut_mem routine.


extern void mut_mem_open(void);

 `mut_mem_open' opens the memory manager.
 `mut_mem_open' must be called after `mut_mem_init' but before any
 other mut_mem routine.  The reason for having `mut_mem_init' and
 `mut_mem_open' is historical and they could easily be combined.


extern FILE *mut_mem_log(FILE *);
extern FILE *mut_mem_report(FILE *);

extern int mut_mem_close(void);

 `mut_mem_close' initialises the memory manager.
 `mut_mem_close' must be called before the program terminates.
 `mut_mem_close' returns XXX.
