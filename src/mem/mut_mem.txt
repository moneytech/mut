.intro: mut_mem.h template

Each mut_mem.h file must contain at least the following, all of which
have the same semantics as as malloc, realloc and free respectively.

extern void * mut_mem_malloc(size_t nbytes);
extern void * mut_mem_realloc(void *p, size_t nbytes);
extern void   mut_mem_free(void *p);
