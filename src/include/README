.intro: MUT specific versions of various header files.

Each directory contains at least a version which just pulls in the
vendor supplied version on the header file.  These are for use on
systems which have decent header files.  On systems which don't
have decent header files (e.g. SunOS), then choose an alternative
sub-directory which contains the required definitions.

Note that only MUT wide include files go here.  Any option specific
header files go in the same directory as the option.  For example, see
<URI:mut/src/exec/elfd/elf> and <URI:mut/src/ptrace/ptrace>.

The above was written on or before 19996-12-22.  As I write this in
2001-01-03 machines with deficient header files are all but dead
(difficult to find a SunOS machine anymore).  So if I was to start
again and/or what to clean things up I'd remove this abstraction since
it is no longer needed.
