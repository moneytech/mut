Some systems have a dodgy assert header file (can't remember which one
now, it has been a few years) or one that results undesirable symbols
being pulled in.  Therefore, mut_assert is used to hide these tedious
details.

vendor
  Just define mut_assert in terms of <assert.h> as defined by the
  vendor.
