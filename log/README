.intro: Work log -- what was done and when.

Each file in the directory corresponds to a day on which MUT was
worked on.  All files are of the form YYYYMMDD.

Didn't start this log until 19961129 so all entries before then were
added at a later date and so are rather sparse.

The best guess as to the project start date is whatever the earliest
dated file is in this directory.  The actual start date has been lost
since I didn't explicitly record it and all machine logs were lost
when I had to do a reinstall from the MCC 1.0+ boot disks on 19961117
due to a mistake I made when installing 2.0.18 which resulted in the
a.out ld.so being removed :-<
