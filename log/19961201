13:56 - start.

14:22 - Decided that rld_backtrace should know about rld_exec rather than
        passing it to the rld_log_backtrace call.  So now displays the
        function name as well as the address :-

./main ../tests/cur_chain
A
./main error 0 CUR 10 foo fa main 135 _entry 39 <?> 0
B
C
./main info process.exited 0
$ 

14:24 - Need to do something about the 0 address ...

14:34 - The 0 is the return address of the top frame.  Need to try out
        on other systems to see what type of return addresses they
        have to decide whether to do anything special about 0.  I
        suspect there isn't and this is x86+a.out specific.

15:34 - Cleaned up rld/README: Separated out the little that was there
        into IDEA, GOALS, REQUIREMENTS, SOLUTIONS and TODO and added a
        lot to the IDEA, GOALS, REQUIREMENTS and SOLUTIONS.  Still
        needs a lot of work though.

15:38 - All the internal work for <URI:mut/doc/req/min.leak> is
        supposedly done, all that is left is to add the code to report
        any leaks and test it.

15:43 - Noticed most of the work has been done for
        <URI:mut/doc/req/desired.free> and that is more
        immediately interesting, so work on that instead.

15:48 - Think break.

16:05 - Back.  Can do CCR by logging the resource as consumed.

16:42 - Now passes the ccr test :-

./main ../tests/ccr
A
B
C
./main error 0 CCR free 7000 free main 127 _entry 39 <?> 0
./main info process.exited 0
$ 

16:44 - Tried to test out rld on otz but found that can't build otz
        since it requires RCS and that has not been re-installed.

16:47 - Something wrong with the logic since when consuming resources,
        it should not be possible to detect CCR errors with the
        current implementation.  However :-

./main -c ../tests/ccr
A
B
C
./main error 0 CCR free 7000 free main 127 _entry 39 <?> 0
./main info process.exited 0
$ 

17:26 - Added consumer name to CUR.

18:03 - Fixed up the logic in the manager regarding consuming.
        However, it has highighted a different problem :-

./main -c ../tests/ccr
A
B
./main fatal 0 action.addr free 8b0 127
$ 

18:06 - Backup.
