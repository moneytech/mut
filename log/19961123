13:47 - Start.

        Tried to untar gdb-4.16.  It failed on the second disk.  This was
        the same disk that was used as the second Plan 9 disk.  Looks like
        the disk is dodgy, so thrown it away.

        After looking at the kernel source for ptrace in Linux 1.0
        noticed that an error is returned if the bottom 2 bits are set
        implying that it expects a word address.  Quickly changed from
        passing EIP directly to passing EIP*4 and finally got the
        correct value back.

        Now things are working.  Prior to this point there was a elf
        reader, non-working ptrace and a non-compiling /proc version.

        Created rld/tests and the malloc.c test.

16:19 - Backup.
