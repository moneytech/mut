19:14 - Start.

        I think this is the day I cleaned up rld_log.

        Also added a backtrace to the info stored.  So far only stores
        frame addresses and is arbitrarily limited to a depth of 5 and
        only works for x86 code with an explicit frame pointer (EBP).

        Added rld/tests/cur_chain.c

22:24 - Backup.
