11:51 - Start.  Earlier this week decided that it would be helpful to
        log how much time was spent working on rld and what was done
        and when.  So created rld/log.

12:40 - Have written up as much as I can remember of past work.

12:50 - Created rld/src/backtrace/fixed and moved
        rld/src/rld_backtrace* there since the current fixed size
        implementation is only one possible implementation.

12:58 - Start adding some documentation to rld/src/counter.

13:05 - Finished initial documentation.  Break for lunch.

13:38 - Finished lunch.  Added best guess as to what was done on
        19961124 and added some new log entries based on looking at
        the dates of some files.

14:05 - Changed rld_exec_addr to be a struct to try and eliminate as
        many implicit type conversions as possible.

14:47 - Finished reworking rld/src/proc/ptrace/arch/x86/rld_process_arch.c
        
14:52 - Added explicit error checks to all ptrace PEEK calls.

16:32 - Introduced rld/src/proc/ptrace/rld_trace.[ch] to add some type
        safety to the ptrace calls.  Also added rld/src/include/ptrace
        to hide differences over the location and prototype for ptrace.

        Rewrote rld/src/proc/ptrace/rld_process.c and
        rld/src/process/proc/trace/x86/rld_process_arch.c in terms of
        rld_trace.  It all passes the cur tests.

17:09 - Food break.

17:35 - Finished food.

18:12 - Removed frame_pointer from backtrace since there doesn't seem
        much point in having it.

18:41 - Change rld/exec/aout so that just the external functions are
        stored rather than all the symbols, and the external functions
        are stored in address order to aid the backtrace process.

20:26 - Done battle with the lack of information in an a.out file and
        finally managed to do a reasonable job of extracting the
        function symbols.

20:41 - Can't decide on the required interface for making the backtrace
        display the full function name + offset.  rld_exec now has the
        necessary addr->name mapping and rld_backtrace has the
        required address.  Does rld_backtrace know about rld_exec or what?

20:44 - Backup.
