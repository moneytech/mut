  Start installing git ...

    # cd /usr/pkgsrc/devel/git

08:27
  Building libcurl.

09:03
  Building git-base

09:55
  Installation phase of git-base.

09:56
  Wants to build git-contrib but that wants
  asciidoc which in turn wants
  docbook-xsl which in turn wants
  xmlcatmgr
  docbook-xml

10:06
  ascidocc wants python27 but that won't install since I don't have X11

    => Returning to build of asciidoc-8.6.9nb2
    => Full dependency python27>=2.7.1nb2: NOT found
    => Verifying reinstall for ../../lang/python27
    ERROR: This package has set PKG_FAIL_REASON:
    ERROR: python27-2.7.12nb4 uses X11, but /usr/X11R7 not found
    *** Error code 1

10:25
  Stop.

16:30
  Restart

16:41
  Not sure of the correct way to avoid python27 wanting X11 so just
  went a head and edited python27/options.mk to stop it requiring X11
  and re-started the build :-

    # cd /usr/pkgsrc/lang/python27
    # make install

17:43
  Finished python so go back and restart the git install :-

    # cd /usr/pkgsrc/devel/git
    # make install

22:47

  Made it through libxslt, libgcypt, libgpg, libxml, xmlto, bison,
  bash, git-contrib and gitdocs only for it to fail on gitk due to the
  lack of tk due to lack of X11 :-

    Stop.

22:53
  Again, not sure of the official way to solve it so just remove
  gitk from /usr/pkgsrc/devel/git/work/.depends.

22:54
  Now have git installed.

10:25
  Stop.
  
16:30
  Restart.

16:41
  Tweaked python27/options.mk to stop it requiring X11.
  Now it is downloading readline

17:16
  Part of the way through compiling python27.

17:43
  Done.  Restarting the git build.
  Which currently seems to be doing more python27 installation.

17:51
  Finished python, now on libxslt.
  which in turn wants libgcrypt.
  which in turn wants libgpg.

19:17
  Finished libxml, now back to libxslt.

19:29
  Done, now building asciidoc.

19:31
  Done, back to git-contrib which wants
  xmlto which wants
  bash which wants bison

19:51
  bison done, back to bash.

20:20
  bash done, now back to xmlto

20:23
  xmlto done, back to git-contrib.

20:27
  git-contrib done, now back to git, but that wants git-docs.

22:10
  Very slowly making its way through asciidoc X.xml && xmlto X.1
  to create the manual page for each git sub command.
  So far up to git-mailinfo.

22:47
  gitdocs done, but now build fails on gitk, or rather tk ...

    Stop.

22:53
  Removed gitk from the work/.depends file.

22:54
  Now have git.

  Tried to download mut from github :-

    # git clone https://github.com/nineties-retro/mut.git
    Cloning into 'mut'...
    fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/nineties-retro/mut.git/':
    SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificatehost

  Tried with openssl s_client and found that all attempts to verify
  server certificates were failing.  Apparently although the CA
  certificates were downloaded as part of either the emacs or git
  install (I forget which) the CAs themselves weren't installed.  That
  was accomplished via :-

    # mozilla-rootcerts install

23:14
  Can now successfully checkout mut from github :-

    # git clone https://github.com/nineties-retro/mut.git
