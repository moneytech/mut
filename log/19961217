17:58 - Start.

        Becoming bored with rld now that I've managed to do most of
        the things I set out to do (try out ELF and ptrace in anger),
        so have decided to concentrated on making sure that
        .goal.desired is satisfied and forget (for now) about
        .goal.max. 

        In the process have decided that a name change is in order.
        RLD was never a good name since it emphasized leak detection
        too much.  Have decided on MUT - Memory Usage Tracker/Tracer.

        A consequence some of the general code to do with actions can
        be ripped out and replaced with simpler, more direct code.
        Will save an archive of the current state so that it is
        possible to resurrect this code in the future if necessary.
        Now is the time I wish I'd found time to reinstall a
        configuration control system or even a revision control
        system :-< 

18:27 - Break

19:07 - Resume.

20:16 - Ripped out most of the action stuff and it is back in a state
        where it passes all the tests again.

        To do:
         * fake up the malloc call on a realloc.
         * embed an action pointer in the action so that the dispatch
           is automatic.

20:19 - Backup.
