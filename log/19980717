10:09 - Start

10:36 - Fixed a few typos in yesterday's version.  Managed to FFM to
        display both its stack traces.  Still cannot deal with no
        backtraces. 

        Typed up yesterday's log and the above.

10:57 - Fixed up WUM.  That appears to be all the errors dealt with, 
        though only in the case where there is a backtrace.  Need to
        decide whether the backend need to include more smarts to
        distinguish the two cases or whether it it is easier to
        include something in the output to make it easier for a
        backend to work it out -- I'm leaning towards the latter.

10:59 - Stop.
