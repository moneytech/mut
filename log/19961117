        Tried installing Plan 9 one last time -- still failed on the 
        second disk.

17:40 - Finished reinstalling Linux 1.0+.

        Created rld/misc.  Moved the ptrace code to rld/misc/ptrace,
        created rld/misc/bach-ptrace to test out ptrace.

        Since the work before this date had beed done with an ELF
        version of 1.2.25, had to write an a.out reader.  See
        rld/misc/aout and rld/src/exec/aout.

        Also realised that RCS doesn't come as part of the Linux
        distribution and so have no revision control available at the
        moment -- that is just when there is some source that it worth
        doing some revision control on!

22:57 - Backup.
