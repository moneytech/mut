Decided to test out the SPARC support to see whether it works.  When
it was last touched around 1997 it was compiling under some vintage of
Solaris.  Junked my last box running Solaris in 2012, so don't have
physical access anymore.  So while investigating how to get SunOS
or Solaris running again under emulation, let's use NetBSD/sparc.
Chose it rather than OpenBSD since NetBSD still maintains sparc wheras
OpenBSD stopped supporting it and now only supports sparc64.  Perhaps
will install an older OpenBSD does or does not work out.

Download NetBSD-7.01-sparc.iso :-

  ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-7.0.1/iso/NetBSD-7.0.1-sparc.iso

Could have used 7.02 but decided to go with not quite the latest
version.

Make a disk image on which to store the NetBSD installation :-

  $ dd if=/dev/zero of=disk.img bs=1048576 count=4096

Decided to go for speed over space and full populate it rather than
using a self-expanding version.  4G is probably overkill but I have
space to spare to no point in using something smaller only to have
something fail later due to lack of space.

Run installation with default user-based networking to avoid having to
install (privileged) tap device under MacOS :-

  $ qemu-system-sparc -m 256 -drive file=disk.img,format=raw,index=0 -net nic -net user -nographic -cdrom NetBSD-7.01-sparc.iso -boot d

Patition the disk such that first parition takes most the disk
and is mounted as / and allocate at least 256 MB for swap.

Do default install (no X11).  This will come back to bite me later as
some packages assume that X11 is installed and so they have to be
tweaked in order to get them to install. 

When offered to configure networking use :-

  ip 10.0.2.15
  gateway 10.0.2.2
  dns 10.0.2.3

which are the default IP addresses that QEMU uses for "-net user".

To simplify the installation of software once booted, take the
option to install pkgsrc.  Note this can take a while depending
on the network connection, took 20+ minutes on residential cable.

Enable sshd and ntpd.

Could add root password and non-privileged user at this stage
but didn't do either.  Select halt/reboot.

To run the installed system :-

  $ qemu-system-sparc -m 256 -drive file=disk.img,format=raw,index=0 -net nic -net user -nographic

On first boot this will take quite while to generate the sshd keys.

Login as root, no password

Networking not configured so for now just use DHCP :-

  # dhclient le0

and to get it permanently enabled :-

  # cat >> /etc/rc.conf
  dhclient=yes
  ^D

Wanted to edit with emacs and directly use git so :-

  # cd /usr/pkgsrc/editors/emacs-nox11
  # make

However, after taking somewhere in the region of 6 hours downloading
and compiling: digest, automake, help2man, gmake, gettext, perl, m4,
and emacs24 the build failed due to :-

    leim/ja-dic/ja-dic.el:16979:1:Error: Memory exhausted--use C-x s
then exit and restart Emacs

Tried re-starting with "-m 512" but it proceeded to start re-compiing
emacs again so just gave up on emacs.
