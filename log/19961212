12:40 - Created rld/src/proc/ptrace/arch/sparc/rld_process_arch.[ch]
        by copying the x86 versions and doing minimal changes to get
        it to compile.

        Installed a cheap hack in rld/src/exec/aout/arch/sparc/rld_aout_mach.h
        just to get the code to compile under SunOS.

        Wrote rld/src/include/{stdio,stdlib,string}/portable/* to get
        rld to compile under SunOS.

13:30 - First run under SunOS.  It failed due to being unable to write
        a value into the text area.  The failure was expected since
        the code hasn't been updated to deal with PC/NPC, but the
        manner of the failure wasn't expected.  Didn't bother to
        persue the problem.  Backup.
