14:53 - Start work on fleshing out mut.sh so that my first external
        user can make some sense of the mut output.

        First thing that needed doing was making a few corrections to
        the ptrace specific stuff in the SPARC version which seems to
        have got out of date wrt to the Linux/x86 version.

        Found I'd forgotten a lot of (Bourne) shell hacking and
        stumbled around for a while trying to get a mechanism to deal
        with dumping stack backtraces.  Wasted almost an hour fiddling
        with expr and then dc to try and calculate the difference
        between two addresses that mut produces, only to find that the
        field that comes afterwards is the difference!  I must have
        realised when I wrote mut that it was easier to write out this
        redundant piece of information than have the backend fiddle
        with caclulating it.

        Did not track time carefully enough to know exactly how much
        time was spent, but around 2 hours would be a good guess.

        By the time I had finished I had a rudimentary backtrace
        support, though I have yet to produce a version that works
        with and without backtraces.
