10:52 - Start.

11:36 - Split the proc directory into proc-sysVr4 and proc-linux since
        their interfaces are so different and added some documentation
        to the Linux version.

11:53 - Break.

12:03 - Resume.

13:29 - Slowly tidying up the code for realloc in preparation for
        adding the zone checking code -- only the two realloc cases
        left to add.

13:32 - Break.

16:39 - Restart.

16:51 - Pulled the zone checking code out of the do_consumer routine so
        that it can be shared by the realloc code.  Test still works ...

$ ./main -cb ../tests/gen/gcc.x86.fp.dynamic.elfd.off.on/exe/wum_malloc.exs
./main info backtrace.off
A
B
./main error WUM free 804969c 80496a8 dead5a59 malloc
$ 

17:11 - Did a bit of work on mut.sh so that it recognizes WUM errors :-

$ ./mut.sh < bob
./main info not enough information available to provide a symbolic
backtrace.

./main error WUM: write to unallocated memory at address 80496a8 detected
during free of 10 byte object at address 804969c allocated by malloc.

$ 

17:14 - Break.

17:55 - Backup.

18:08 - Shutdown
