15:07 - Start.
        Redo the <URI:mut/src/exec> interface.  The current one is
        too general, it was designed to support RLD which needed to
        look up arbitrary functions rather than MUT which really only
        needs to know about 5.

16:16 - Changes done, all tests pass.

16:31 - Updated <URI:mut/src/exec/mut_exec.h>

16:46 - Added -n option and changed -l -> -o.  Regenerated tests answers.

17:10 - Updated <MUT:mut/doc/mut.1> wrt to above changes.

17:13 - Break.
