.intro: tests for MUT.


COMPILING THE TESTS

.compiling.flags:  The following is a list of the various flags which
 control which variant of mut is actually compiled.

  CC:		{gcc, lcc}
  arch:		{x86, sparc}
  fp:		{fp, nfp}
  linkage:	{dynamic, static}
  exec:		{aout, elf}

.compiling.flags.alter:  To alter a value, you can either edit the
 Makefile (<URI:rld/tests/Makefile>) or just pass the value as a comand
 line option to make.  For example, to compile with lcc rather than gcc :-

	$ make CC=lcc

 Note that not all permutations are valid.

 The results of compilation are stored in the gen subdirectory.


ADDING A NEW TEST

.add: How to add a new test file.

.add.file: Each test should consist of a single C file.

.add.make: Add the name of the file to the tests definition 
 <URI:mut/tests/Makefile#tests>
